This includes the significant investments that are needed to renew their assets, connect new generation, and keep the system safe and reliable.\nPrice controls are a method of setting the amount of money (allowance) that can be earned by the DNOs over the length of a price control. DNOs recover their allowance from charges to energy suppliers, who in turn pass these costs on to customers through their energy bills.

However, there is significant potential for much greater coherence in forward planning and targeted investment through improved collaboration with wider stakeholders and across energy networks. This must include regional and local stakeholders, as the contributions of these parties will be critical in supporting the creation of least cost decarbonisation pathways for electricity, heat, and transport, in part through the development of ambitious LAEPs.\n4.104 We have decided that the purpose of the SOO remains as the proposed 'whole system strategic planning' was described at Draft Determinations.

The infrequent issuer premium reflects an increase in the cost of new debt for those notional licensees that are expected to issue smaller size new debt or issue new debt less frequently than other networks, due to their smaller RAV sizes and/or lower RAV growth for RIIO-ED2. At the DD stage, we proposed to apply a 6bps infrequent issuer allowance on the overall cost of debt. We proposed that the premium would be applied at a licensee level for those meeting a given issuance size threshold. The threshold was defined as average RIIO-ED2 annual issuance of £150m; the premium would apply to licensees under this threshold. Based on calculations at DDs, three licensees would have received this premium (LPN, NPgN and NGED SWALES). In their responses to DDs, five DNOs (ENWL, SPEN, SSEN, NPg and UKPN) focused on three issues with the approach we proposed in DDs. Firstly, that the 6bps on the cost of debt was insufficient. Secondly, whether the eligibility should be assessed on an ownership basis, rather than on a licensee basis. Thirdly, that the infrequent issuer premium threshold should be increased to £250m p.a. The RIIO-ED2 Challenge Group indicated that an infrequent issuer premium is not necessary, especially for licensees that are a part of large groups. We have decided on a 6bps infrequent issuer premium which will be applied at the individual licensee level. We have also decided to increase the eligibility threshold for the infrequent issuer premium to £250m p.a. As a result of this decision, eleven licensees will receive the 6bps allowance for RIIO-ED2. Each recipient has average annual issuance less than the £250m p.a. threshold. There are three licensees whose expected issuance is greater than the £250m p.a. threshold so do not receive the premium - these are SSES, NGED EMID and UKPN EPN. This assessment is for RIIO-ED2 only, and we expect to revisit our approach and assumptions of infrequent issuance at future price control reviews.'}]","[""The eligibility requirement for the infrequent issuer premium under RIIO-ED2 is that the licensee's average annual debt issuance must be less than £250m."", 'Eligible licensees will receive a 6bps increase in their allowed cost of debt.']",SYNTHETIC_FROM_DOC,RIIO-ED2 Final Determinations Finance Annex.pdf
