Here are examples of how to format the results:

Example 1:
Acronym: DSO
Definition: Distribution System Operation
Certainty: 95

Example 2:
Acronym: ODI
Definition: Output Delivery Incentive

Now, go through the following document chunk and identify all acronyms and their definitions:
- Acronyms must have definitions found within the document chunk itself (no invented definitions).
- For each acronym, provide:
  - The acronym itself.
  - The definition as stated in the document chunk.
  - A certainty score (out of 100) based on how likely it is that the definition is correct.

Respond ONLY with the JSON format containing the fields: "acronym", "definition", "certainty". Do not include any explanations or notes.
